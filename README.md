# colormap_matplotlib_matlab
matplotlib colormaps for matlab

Just a small utility to export colormaps directly from matplotlib in python and use them in matlab.

```matlab
cmapnames=colormap_matplotlib('list'); % retrieve list of available colormap names

cmap=colormap_matplotlib('magma'); %retrieve a specific colormap

%example:
imagesc(rand(10));
colormap(colormap_matplotlib('magma'));
```

By default, the following colormaps are available (Or see [here](colormap_matplotlib_withr.png) for reversed versions with "_r")
![available colormaps](colormap_matplotlib.png)
(Generated by [example.m](example.m))

This list was generated using Python 3.7.10 and matplotlib 3.2.2. If your matplotlib has additional colormaps you would like to include, you can regenerate this file with:
```shell
python save_matplotlib_colormaps.py matplotlib_colormaps.mat
````
